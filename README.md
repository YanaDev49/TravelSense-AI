#### At Trainline, we're dedicated to solving Problems to deliver pragmatical and simple solutions 📈

### So imagine this...  🤔

#### Meet our Trainliner, Ruby 👋

![alt text](image-3.png)

Ruby is travelling to Milan using Trainline’s services, but she hasn’t planned out her journey or itinerary. She decides to explore Trainline’s Inspiration travel blog 🌍 and Europe travel itinerary 🗺️ for some ideas. While these resources provide some great inspiration, Ruby feels she still needs a more structured and tailored plan to guide her trip.

That’s when she discovers Trainline’s newly launched Tailored-line feature 👀✨ a tool designed to create personalised travel itineraries with just one click. Instead of piecing together a plan herself and risking potential mistakes 🚧; especially in an unfamiliar city 🏙️, Ruby now has a seamless, all-in-one itinerary created just for her. In moments, her travel worries are replaced with excitement 🎉, and she’s ready to enjoy her trip with clarity and confidence 😊.

Let’s take a closer look at Ruby’s experience with Tailored-line AI and how this personalised approach transforms travel planning into a stress-free and enjoyable process 🚆💼.

##

## Ruby's Tailored Experience 🧭

![alt text](image-4.png)

All Ruby needs to do is enter her Trainline user ID so that Tailored-line can sync her account and previous travel history to understand logical travel preferences like student discount , cheapest fare , first class , and refundable tickets.

Then she can select the "Get Travel Recommendations" button to move on to the next stage. 👉📲

![alt text](image-5.png)

 Ruby is then greeted by our Tailored-line bot and is encouraged to take a quick travel questionnaire that will take some details about her trip 📝. These details will be used as data to generate her personalised itinerary based on factual information about her travel.🌍

![alt text](image-6.png)

This questionnaire is designed specifically to collect data about Ruby's travel destination (Milan)📍...

![alt text](image-7.png)

Ruby's Dietary Requirements (in this instance, Ruby is vegan) 🥗

![alt text](image-8.png)

The area of Ruby's stay location (hotel) 🏨

![alt text](image-9.png)

And Ruby's activity preferences 🎨🏞️...

Now, this is where the magic ✨ actually begins as Ruby is redirected to a Trainline webpage with her personalised itinerary displayed in sequenced and organised sections! 📄🗺️🚆

![alt text](image-10.png)

The first section will display places that Ruby can visit on her trip to Milan 🏛️🖼️ based on the preferences selected in the questionnaire! 

![alt text](image-11.png)

The second section will display vegan dining options for Ruby 🥗🌱, taking away the hassle of having to search for all of these restaurants beforehand. 🍴✅

![alt text](image-12.png)

The third section will display train stations 🚉 in or near the area of Ruby's hotel 🏨. This is to ensure that Ruby can get around the city with the knowledge of transport facilities, making travelling around Milan much easier. 🚆🗺️

![alt text](image-13.png)

The fourth and last section will display some travel tips 💡 that Ruby may benefit from on her trip. This will include the best ways to save money 💷 and the recommended methods of transport. 🚖💼

![alt text](image-14.png)

This is a concise and clear representation of how Tailored-line AI will be experienced by our users and how implementing a real-life example (Ruby) can really make this feature come to life. ✨

Tailored-line isn’t just an additional feature for trainline services. It’s a system that allows our customers to have a fulfilling, personalised, and safe travel experience, making every trip enjoyable and seamless. 🚆

Ultimately, people may not remember what a service did for them, but how the service made them feel and the lengths gone to create that impact (like it did for Ruby 😊).

# How Hypothesis-Driven Development became the backbone of Tailored-line 🔍🧩

![alt text](image-16.png)

Software development often involves a degree of **uncertainty**. Developers strive to solve problems and build features that meet user needs, but it’s all too easy to fall into the trap of building for **assumptions** rather than facts. 🔍

I first encountered the concept of **Hypothesis-Driven Development (HDD)** while reading a blog post on Trainline’s Medium channel titled *"Lessons from Hypothesis-Driven Development."* The post discussed how **HDD** had become a core practice within Trainline's **Conversion Rate Optimisation (CRO)** team, which I found very interesting. 📚

After reading this, I began to reflect on my own development process and asked myself, *'How can I implement this solution within Tailored-line?'* It struck me that using **HDD** could provide a more **systematic** and **pragmatic** way to ensure that my feature was truly aligned with **user needs** at Trainline and delivered **meaningful value**. 💡

Following this, I started researching the impact of **tailored** and **personalised** features on **user engagement**. A study titled *"Validation of User Preferences and Effects of Personalized Gamification"* found that **software features reflecting user preferences significantly improve engagement and task performance**. Participants using **personalised settings** reported a more enjoyable experience and showed higher interaction rates. 📊

For Tailored-line, having a **questionnaire** to gather data about users' **travel preferences** and syncing itineraries with their **past travel history** can improve **engagement**. This approach enhances the **relevance** of travel recommendations and creates a more **seamless**, **personalised travel experience**. ✈️

**[Link to study](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/computer-science/articles/10.3389/fcomp.2020.00029/full)** 📎

This research helped me foresee how **Tailored-line** could **positively impact Trainline’s customers**. By going the extra mile to ensure that each **itinerary recommendation** was **thoughtfully tailored** to individual preferences, the app wouldn’t just meet **user needs** but would create **moments of delight**. It became clear to me that **HDD** wasn’t just a method to improve **accuracy**, it was a way to embed **empathy** into development. ✨

The process of applying **HDD** to **Tailored-line** has been a **transformative experience**. It taught me to think more **critically** about the **purpose** behind every feature I develop. It also showed me that by taking a **hypothesis-driven approach**, we can build more **meaningful products** that **resonate with users on a deeper level**. 💻


### Now, Lets dive into the technical Components of Tailored-line and how the technologies I used assemble together to create this solution!
#

# 📝 Technologies I used for Tailored-line 📋

### These are the core technologies used to build and run the application itself:

| **Technologies**            | **Description**                          |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 🐍 **Python Flask**          | I used Flask to build the backend of my app, handling the user questionnaire and generating personalised itineraries based on the data collected. |
| 📦 **Redis**                 | Redis is used to store the answers from my questionnaire and manage session data, ensuring quick access to user responses and improving the app’s performance. |
| 📜 **JavaScript**            | I used JavaScript to make the frontend interactive and responsive, allowing users to smoothly complete the questionnaire and view their personalised itineraries. |
| 🧠 **Model**                 | I developed a model that processes user responses from the questionnaire to generate personalised itineraries tailored to Trainline user preferences. |
| 🌐 **HTML**                  | HTML structures the content of my app’s user interface, making it straightforward for users to navigate through the questionnaire and results. |
| 🎨 **CSS**                   | CSS styles the user interface, ensuring the app looks clean, modern, and visually appealing. |
| 🐳 **Docker Compose**        | I used Docker Compose to manage both the app and its dependencies, such as Redis, making it simple to deploy my application consistently across different environments. |
| 🛠️ **Docker**                | Docker allowed me to containerise my app, ensuring it runs smoothly and reliably on any system without compatibility issues. |

# Key parts of my code and explanation 📡💻

![alt text](image-18.png)

In essence, **Tailored-line** is a **Flask** web application that uses a **Python** module **model** to simulate the behaviour of a **recommendation system/machine learning AI model**. It uses **data** from the **user questionnaire** and stores this in the **Redis database** so that it can be retrieved to generate the **personalised itinerary** for the user.

The **Python** module uses **pre-loaded CSV data files** of **user travel preferences** and **train schedules** to apply **logic**, creating the perfect **recommended travel options** for their journey. The **model** joins the **data** from the **CSV files** with the **data** stored in **Redis** from the **questionnaire** and generates a **personalised itinerary** for the user based on all this **data**.


 

### Lets take a look at the main code functions of Tailored-line
#
#### app.py code

![alt text](image-19.png)

This is the **/recommend** route that handles the part of the application that takes in the **user inputs** as **data** in **Redis** and uses a function to generate the user's **itinerary** and load the **data** to do this.

The **/recommend** route handles both **GET** and **POST** requests. The **GET** request is specifically for saving **user questionnaire data** in **Redis** and the **POST** request is for displaying the **itinerary** within the function **generate_itinerary()**.
 

# 

#### model.py code

![alt text](image-20.png)

This is apart of my **model.py** code that shows the process of joining the **travel preferences** and **train schedule CSV file data** and applying **logic** to match key-value pairs like **is_student = student discount** in a **get_recommendations** function. This matches **travel preferences** with correct **values** to create perfect **tailored options**.

#

#### Javascript code 

![alt text](image-21.png)

The function **LoadQuestions()** displays each question dynamically on the **user page** and checks for the right **input data** which is the **expected response**.

![alt text](image-22.png)

The **updateJsonString()** function stores the **user data inputs** from the **questionnaire** as a **JSON string**.

![alt text](image-23.png)

The **submitToQuestionnaire()** function communicates with the **Python backend** and sends the **user inputs** in the form of **JSON data** as a **POST request** to the **/recommend** route.
#

# What I learned from developing Tailored-line (Errors, Concepts, Engineering and more!)💡

![alt text](image-24.png)

### concepts:

 Developing **Tailored-line** challenged me to think critically about making certain **decisions** such as what **database** to use to store **user inputs** and how to handle **user data** to make **predictions** for the **itinerary**.

I thought about the **functionality** of my application and knew I would need a **database** that could quickly retrieve **data** in a **cached state**.

In regards to the **Python module (model)** that I used to handle the **data**, I initially settled on researching different types of **machine learning models** to fit within this feature. However, I realised that understanding the **principles of machine learning** and how to **train a machine learning model** to understand and process **data** would require extensive **time and research**.

The **Python module (model)** handles the **data** using **recommendation logic** to create the perfect **travel options** with **key-value pairs**. It **cross joins** data from **preloaded CSV files** along with **JSON data** stored in **Redis** with the **user inputs** from the **travel questionnaire**.

#

### Errors:

 In my application, one of the purposes of my **JavaScript** code was to store **user inputs** as a **JSON string** so that it could communicate a **POST request** to the **backend** to send the **user input data** to generate the **itinerary**.

However, there was an **error** in my **JavaScript** code where it was sending **multiple POST requests** to the **backend Python code**. This caused my **Python code** to have trouble processing all these **requests** and to understand which **request** was in **JSON form**.

![alt text](image-25.png)

To solve this problem, I had to add a **HTTP header** within my **Python code** to ensure that the **POST requests** were in **JSON form** before processing it for the **itinerary**. (The HTTP header is what makes sure the data is in JSON form so that the backend can process the request.)

#
# Improvements I could have made with Tailored-line ✅📈

### Implementing realtime machine learning model:

 One of the key **improvements** I could implement with **Tailored-line** is using an actual **machine learning model** to present a **realtime experience** for the application.

While the **Python module (model)** simulates an **AI experience**, having a real **trained model** to perform the **function** of the application improves overall **user experience** and **organisation** of the **code**.


### Improving adaptability of code:

 When thinking about my **application** in a **production** sense, I think I could have improved my **code** by developing it to **receive** all different types of **user inputs**.

For example, the current **code** in my **application** is specifically developed to represent our **Trainliner 'Ruby'**, with **pre-configured travel data** and **inputs** from her **questionnaire**. However, this **application** will need to be open to **receiving** all different types of **user inputs** from different **user destinations**, **dietary requirements**, to **travel preferences**.

This is what will make **Tailored-line** **inclusive** to all **users**, by adapting the **code** to be **receptive** to all **user inputs**.

### Thinking about scalability:

 Although I thought carefully about each and every **technology** I used in my **application**, thinking about **optimisation** and **scalability** would have improved the overall **system design** and **architecture**.

For example, understanding whether I would need to **vertically** or **horizontally scale** my **application**. **Tailored-line** is a feature intended to be used by **billions of Trainline users** simultaneously, meaning that **horizontal scaling** would be something I would need to think about (adding more **servers** to my **machine** to handle **user traffic**).

Critically thinking about how much **data traffic** would be coming in and out of the **application** is crucial as well, and therefore applying concepts such as **database replication** would need to be considered additionally.
